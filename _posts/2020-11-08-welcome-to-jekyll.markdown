Xanadu is a WIP *roguelite* platformer inspired by games such as *Spelunky* and *Rogue Legacy*. 

## Technology

Xanadu is built with **LibGDX** in Kotlin, using the **Ashley** Entity-Component-System framework. 

## Building the game

The project uses the Gradle build system. Simply importing the project in **IntelliJ** and launching the game via **DesktopLauncher** should be enough.

### Deploying

//TBD
